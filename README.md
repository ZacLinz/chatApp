This project is a React-Native project

To run, you must first install expo. You can do this by running:

### `npm install expo-cli -g`

## Required Libraries

To install all dependencies, you can run:

### `npm install --save @react-native-community/netinfo @types/react-native-keyboard-spacer expo-image-picker expo-location expo-permission firebase prop-types react react-dom react-native react-native-gesture-handler react-native-gifted-chat react-native-keyboard-spacer react-native-maps react-native-web react-navigation react-navigation-stack`

You can then get the app to start by running:

### `npm start`

This will launch DevTools on port 19002. You can then run the app on a physical device or emulator by either scanning the QR code or by creating and signing into an expo account. To run on your device, you can download and install the expo app from the app store.</br>

For information on how to set up an emulator for testing, you can visit [this page](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/android-studio-emulator/). You can then press "Run on Android device/emulator" in the DevTools to launch the app on your emulator.
